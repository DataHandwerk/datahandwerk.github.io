    # You can use the kroki-fetch-diagram option to download the images from Kroki at build time. In other words, while viewing pages you won't rely on Kroki anymore.
    # However, in Antora, this is not currently compatible with inline SVG images.

    # required for interactive diagram, but it is good idea in general
    # use SVG unless otherwise specified

  # no redirects will be created in combination with redirect_facility: static
  # but this could be useful if the site would be published on netlify or gitlab
  # but the required redirect logic is not supported on github
  # 'redirect:to' will create 'current' instead of the latest version
  # this would allow static link to the latest version, also on github
  # but it will not work for renamed, added, deleted pages

  # a hoster like netlify would be required, then the value could be netlify
  # use 'netlify' for gitlab in folder public and 'static' for github in folder docs
